# Mentoria
Mentoria is a comprehensive web-based application designed to enhance educational management and analysis. Built using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend, the application incorporates cutting-edge technologies to provide advanced functionalities, including timetable generation using Reinforcement Learning (RL), automatic question paper generation with Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student data.
Features

## 1. Timetable Generation
* Utilizes Reinforcement Learning algorithms to generate optimized and conflict-free timetables for classes.
* Considers constraints like teacher availability, subject preferences, and classroom capacity.
## 2. Question Paper Generation
* Employs Natural Language Processing techniques to generate questions and their corresponding answers.
* Supports customization of:
 <br/> Number of questions
 <br/>Marks allocation
 <br/> Uses advanced NLP for intelligent question generation.
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Provides insights into student performance, attendance trends, and academic progress.
Visualizes data through interactive charts and graphs to aid decision-making.
